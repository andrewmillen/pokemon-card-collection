# My Pokemon Card Collection

! Work In Progress

As I attempt to finish collecting all 151 original pokemon cards from the 1999 base, jungle, and fossil sets, I thought it'd be fun to create a digital inventory of my cards.

Not entirely sure what I'll do with this little app â€“ it's still a WIP for now.
